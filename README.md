# Sequence-Alignment-Python

Interactive Python script that allows user to:
  1. Identify a family of protein sequences from a user-defined subset of the taxonomic tree that can then be processed for further analysis
  2. Determine, and plot, the level of protein sequence conservation across the species within that taxonomic group to scan the protein sequence(s) of interest with motifs from the PROSITE database, to determine whether any known motifs (domains) are associated with this subset of sequences
  3. Perform evolutionary distance analysis (EMBOSS tool)
